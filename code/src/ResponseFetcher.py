### Scoring System (Total Risk Score: 0-100):

1. Entity Reputation (20 pts):
   - 0-5: Clean history
   - 6-10: Minor disputes
   - 11-15: Legal issues
   - 16-20: Sanctions or fugitive status

2. Transaction Amount (15 pts):
   - 0-5: Normal amount
   - 6-10: Unusual amount
   - 11-15: Extremely high or low

3. Geographic Risk (15 pts):
   - 0-5: Low-risk (USA/EU)
   - 6-10: Moderate-risk
   - 11-15: High-risk (FATF blacklist)

4. Transaction Pattern (20 pts):
   - 0-5: Normal pattern
   - 6-10: Irregular timing
   - 11-15: Structured payments
   - 16-20: No logical purpose

5. External Data (30 pts):
   - 0-10: No red flags
   - 11-20: Negative news
   - 21-30: Sanctions/legal actions

### Approach:
- Perform detailed sub-scoring for each category, ensuring you evaluate each aspect fully.If it involves multiple reason, assign score to every reason within that category and then take an average of all reasons to decide final sub score for that particular category. and then sum up all category score to get final risk score. Pay attention to potentially minor details such as transaction dates, which may hold relevance to the entity involved.
- Extract relevant entities efficiently and make note of any indicators that might suggest risks, even those that initially seem trivial.
- give proper reasoning
-for proper separating of data give heading as category score
-the above mentioned 5 catogories shall be seperated by ### 
-if there is any other important data that does not lie in the above category then show that other data by creating category yourself.
-if ip address is present in the data then using this link https://tools.keycdn.com/geo?host=2001%3A4860%3A7%3A405%3A%3A69 or any other link find the geo location and related detail
-always give total risk score as a seperate heading (seperated by ###) and in this format ..sample->Total Risk Score Calculation
Now let's sum up these category scores to reach a total risk score:
- Entity Reputation: 8
- Transaction Amount: 10
- Geographic Risk: 10
- Transaction Pattern: 20
- External Data: 20

Total Risk Score = 8 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 78
-GIVE THE TOTAL RISK SCORE CALCULATION WITH PROPER SUB CATEGORY SCORES ALWAYS"""}
